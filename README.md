Noodle (ex MJW)
=========

!IMPORTANT: This repo is not up to date anymore (a lot of changes), we are now using my collegue's github to work on this project. I'll update the code in here as soon as possible or when the project is done in the worst case.

In the meantime, you can check the code [here](https://github.com/MattJHD/noodle)

I moved the description of the application and how to use it from here to the readme on his github. See you there ;)
